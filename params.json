{"name":"vFeed","tagline":"The Open Source Cross Linked Vulnerability Database","body":"### Concept\r\nvFeed is an open source naming scheme concept that provides extra structured detailed 3rd parties references for a CVE entry. \r\nWhile the emergence of the Open Standards helped undeniably to shape a new way to communicate about vulnerabilities , the new vFeed is adding an intelligent structured xml feed that provides effective level of information (meta-data) related to vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Key features\r\n\r\n* Built using open source technologies\r\n* Fully downloadable SQLite local vulnerability database \r\n* Structured new XML format to describe vulnerabilities\r\n* Based on major open standards CVE, CPE, CWE, CVSS..\r\n* Support correlation with 3rd party security references (CVSS, OSVDB, OVALâ€¦)\r\n* Extended to support correlation with security assessment and patch vendors (Nessus, Exploit-DB, Redhat, Microsoft..)\r\n* Simple & ready to use Python module with more than 15 methods\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Target Audience\r\nvFeed is appropriate for:\r\n\r\n* Penetration testers who want to analyze CVEs and gather extra information to help shape avenues to exploit vulnerabilities.\r\n* Security auditors who want to report accurate information about findings. vFeed could be the best way to describe a CVE with attributes based on standards and 3rd party references as vendors or companies involved into standarization efforts.\r\n* Security tools vendors / security open source developers who need to implement libraries to enumerate useful information about CVEs without wasting time to correlate and to create a proprietary database. vFeed is by far the best solution. Methods can be invoked from programs or scripts with a simple call.\r\n* Any security hacker who is conducting researches and need a very fast and accurate way to enumerate available exploits or techniques to check a vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject concept and idea by @[toolswatch](https://github.com/toolswatch)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with vFeed?
